# DataAvatarGo

DataAvatarGo aims to perform reincarnation of personal data entities in unstructured data sets. This project was created in March-2019, for [IIM Ahmedabadâ€™s second hackathon](https://sites.google.com/iimahd.ernet.in/hackathon-icadabai2019/home), organized in collaboration with IBM, at [ICADABAI 2019](https://sites.google.com/iimahd.ernet.in/hackathon-icadabai2019/home).

## Problem Statement

> A famous study found that with the date of birth, gender, and five-digit zip code you can uniquely identify about 87% of Americans.

After **Data Protection Regulations** like [GDPR](https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FGeneral_Data_Protection_Regulation&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AFQjCNFZDoQ-bJV5QtpyAldQEG1GWL5l3w) in the European Union and the [Personal Data Protection Bill 2018](http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fmeity.gov.in%2Fwritereaddata%2Ffiles%2FPersonal_Data_Protection_Bill%2C2018.pdf&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AFQjCNGdvYBwwcQChDsXip2rZzziO2afpA) in India, there is increasing regulatory backing for our privacy, and the protection of our personal data. It is also a big challenge for companies to protect the personal data entity of customers. A Personal Data Entity is any entity that can help identify or profile a person, and hence needs to be protected.  

#### How can we solve it?

If we create a algorithm to automatically impute values for the redacted portions in a text, which are known to have contained Personal Data Entities (PDEs), then we can protect the PDEs.
